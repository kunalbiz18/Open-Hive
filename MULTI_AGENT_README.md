# Multi-Agent Chatbot System

A sophisticated multi-agent collaboration system that orchestrates specialized AI agents to solve complex problems through coordinated expertise and collaborative refinement.

## üéØ Overview

This system implements a multi-agent workflow similar to mgx.dev, where:

1. **Leader Agent** analyzes and enhances user queries
2. **Expert Agents** work on specialized tasks in parallel
3. **Collaboration Phase** allows agents to refine each other's work
4. **Reducer Agent** synthesizes everything into a coherent final solution

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`MultiAgentOrchestrator`**: Main orchestration logic
- **`MultiAgentChat`**: React interface component
- **`AgentSelector`**: UI for choosing expert agents
- **`SessionViewer`**: Displays workflow and results
- **API Routes**: `/api/multi-agent` endpoint

### Agent Categories

Each category has multiple specialized agents to choose from:

#### üî¨ **Researcher**
- **Dr. Academic**: Academic research and scholarly analysis
- **Market Analyst**: Business intelligence and market research
- **Tech Researcher**: Technology trends and technical feasibility

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Engineer**
- **Software Architect**: System design and technical implementation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and operational excellence
- **Data Engineer**: Data pipelines and processing solutions

#### üé® **Designer**
- **UX Designer**: User experience and usability focus
- **Visual Designer**: Aesthetics and visual communication
- **Product Designer**: Product strategy and user value

#### üßê **Critic**
- **Constructive Critic**: Supportive feedback and improvement
- **Analytical Critic**: Logical analysis and objective evaluation
- **Devil's Advocate**: Challenging assumptions and risk identification

#### ‚úçÔ∏è **Writer**
- **Creative Writer**: Engaging storytelling and narratives
- **Technical Writer**: Clarity and user comprehension
- **Strategic Communicator**: Communication strategy and audience alignment

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Access the System

Navigate to `/multi-agent` in your application to access the multi-agent interface.

### 2. Select Your Expert Team

Choose one agent from each of the five categories:
- Researcher
- Engineer
- Designer
- Critic
- Writer

### 3. Describe Your Problem

Provide a detailed description of what you want to accomplish. The more specific you are, the better the agents can collaborate.

### 4. Execute Collaboration

Click "Start Multi-Agent Collaboration" to begin the workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**: Leader enhances your query and assigns tasks
2. **Execution Phase**: Expert agents work on their specialized areas
3. **Collaboration Phase**: Agents review and refine each other's work
4. **Reduction Phase**: Final synthesis into coherent output

### 5. Review Results

The SessionViewer provides three tabs:
- **Workflow**: Step-by-step progress through the phases
- **Responses**: Individual agent contributions and refinements
- **Final Output**: Synthesized solution from all agents

## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint

```typescript
POST /api/multi-agent
{
  "userQuery": "Your problem description",
  "agentSelection": {
    "researcher": "researcher-academic",
    "engineer": "engineer-software",
    "designer": "designer-ux",
    "critic": "critic-constructive",
    "writer": "writer-technical"
  }
}
```

### Client Functions

```typescript
import { callMultiAgentAPI } from '@/lib/multiAgentClient';

const session = await callMultiAgentAPI(userQuery, agentSelection);
```

### Orchestration Flow

```typescript
import { MultiAgentOrchestrator } from '@/lib/multiAgentOrchestrator';

const orchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator(userQuery, agentSelection);
const session = await orchestrator.execute();
```

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Agents

1. Define the agent in `lib/agents.ts`:
```typescript
{
  id: 'your-agent-id',
  name: 'Agent Name',
  category: 'researcher', // or other category
  description: 'Agent description',
  expertise: ['skill1', 'skill2'],
  personality: 'Agent personality description',
  systemPrompt: 'Detailed system prompt for the agent'
}
```

2. The agent will automatically appear in the selection interface.

### Modifying Agent Prompts

Edit the `systemPrompt` field in `lib/agents.ts` to customize how each agent behaves and responds.

### Custom Categories

To add new agent categories:
1. Update `AgentCategory` type in `lib/multiAgentTypes.ts`
2. Add category to `AgentSelection` type
3. Update the UI components to include the new category

## üîç Example Use Cases

### Product Development
- **Researcher**: Market analysis and user research
- **Engineer**: Technical feasibility and architecture
- **Designer**: UX/UI design and user experience
- **Critic**: Risk assessment and improvement suggestions
- **Writer**: Product messaging and documentation

### Business Strategy
- **Researcher**: Competitive analysis and market trends
- **Engineer**: Technology stack and implementation
- **Designer**: Brand identity and visual strategy
- **Critic**: Strategic risks and alternatives
- **Writer**: Communication strategy and messaging

### Technical Problem Solving
- **Researcher**: Best practices and current solutions
- **Engineer**: Technical implementation and architecture
- **Designer**: User interface and experience considerations
- **Critic**: Potential issues and edge cases
- **Writer**: Documentation and user guides

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Real-time Streaming
- Implement Server-Sent Events for live status updates
- Show agent responses as they're generated
- Real-time collaboration visualization

### Interactive Refinement
- Allow users to ask follow-up questions to specific agents
- Enable manual task reassignment during execution
- Support for iterative problem-solving cycles

### Advanced Orchestration
- Dynamic agent selection based on problem complexity
- Automatic task decomposition and assignment
- Multi-round collaboration with feedback loops

### Integration Features
- Export results to various formats (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
- Integration with project management tools
- API for external system integration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Selection Incomplete**: Ensure all 5 categories have agents selected
2. **API Errors**: Check that the OpenRouter API is properly configured
3. **Slow Responses**: Complex queries may take time for full collaboration
4. **Parsing Errors**: The system includes fallbacks for malformed responses

### Debug Mode

Enable console logging to see detailed workflow information:
```typescript
// In the browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug-multi-agent', 'true');
```

## üìö Dependencies

- **Next.js 15**: React framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and UI components
- **OpenRouter API**: AI model access for agent reasoning

## ü§ù Contributing

To contribute to the multi-agent system:

1. Follow the existing code structure and patterns
2. Add comprehensive TypeScript types for new features
3. Include proper error handling and fallbacks
